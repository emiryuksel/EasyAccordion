# Simple Accordion Component

This project is a minimal implementation of a simple accordion component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The accordion allows users to expand or collapse content sections, making it perfect for FAQs, dropdowns, or any situation where space-saving is necessary.

## Features

- Clean and simple accordion layout
- Smooth transitions between open/close states
- Responsive design, adaptable for various screen sizes
- Modern visual effects using box shadows for a sleek and polished UI

## CSS Design Enhancements

To enhance the visual design of the accordion, I've integrated subtle box shadow effects inspired by examples found on [Get CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com). These shadows add depth and improve the overall user experience by making the accordion panels stand out more effectively. You can check out various CSS box-shadow examples from the site to further customize or improve this design.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-accordion.git

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the accordion in action.

## Usage

- The accordion component can be easily customized by modifying the HTML structure or adjusting the CSS styles for a different look.
